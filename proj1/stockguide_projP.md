- Column2 is your self-assessment. For each items, score yourself zero (none), one (a litte), two (somewhat), three (a lot).
- Column3 is for any links you  are adding to support your claim in column two.
- At the top, show the sum of column2

|Notes|Score|Evidence|
|-----|------|---------|
|Use of syntax checkers. |0||
|Use of code coverage |0||
|Other automated analysis tools|0||
|Test cases exist|0|dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base: code coverage is not reported and tests under test directory do not seems sufficient |
|Test cases are routinely executed|0|E.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|0||
|Issues are discussed before they are closed, even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here|1| For some yes, and for some no.
